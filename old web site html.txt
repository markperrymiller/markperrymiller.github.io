<p><a href="AISInfo.htm">ALLELES IN SPACE (AIS)</a><br>A computer program for 
the joint analysis of inter-individual spatial and genetic information.&nbsp; 
This program performs a variety of spatial analyses with genetic data including:&nbsp; 
Mantel Tests, Spatial Autocorrelation Analyses, Allelic Aggregation Index 
Analyses (AAIA), Mommonier's Algorithm, and &quot;Genetic Landscape Shape&quot; 
interpolations (Click <a href="AISscreenshots.htm">here</a> to see some examples 
of graphical outputs produced by the program).&nbsp; Please refer to

of Heredity</i> 96: 722-723 (2005)</a> for more information.<p><a href="tfpga.htm">TFPGA</a>
<br>Tools for Population Genetic Analyses: A Windows program for the analysis
of allozyme and molecular population genetic data. This program calculates
descriptive statistics, genetic distances, and F-statistics. It also performs
tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, exact tests for genetic differentiation,
Mantel tests, and UPGMA cluster analyses. Additional features include the
ability to analyze hierarchical data sets as well as data from either codominant
markers such as allozymes or dominant markers such as AFLPs or RAPDs.

<br>R by C: A program that performs Fisher's Exact test on any sized contingency
table through the use of the Metropolis algorithm
<p><a href="mantel.htm">MANTEL-STRUCT</a>
<br>A program that tests for population structure through the use of Mantel
Tests. Please refer to 
<a href="http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/90/1/258.full.pdf+html"> <i>Journal of Heredity</i> 90: 258-259 (1999)</a>. <b>NOTE:</b>
This program does NOT perform standard matrix correlation analyses.
<p><a href="amovaprep.htm">AMOVA-PREP</a>
<br>This program reads raw data sets and prepares all input files needed
for use with Laurent Excoffier's WINAMOVA program. It is intended only
for use with dominant marker data such as AFLPs or RAPDs.

<br>Confidence Intervals for Sage Tags:&nbsp; A Windows program for the
analysis of gene expression data generated using SAGE (Serial Analysis
of Gene Expression).
